# Usage:

Go into the folder that you just cloned, open git bash or terminal, type "npm i", fill out the .env.EXAMPLE file and rename the file to .env. You would then run the schema.sql in the db folder in mysql workbench. Once all of that is done you can seed the database by running the command "npm run seed" and then npm start to run the server.
